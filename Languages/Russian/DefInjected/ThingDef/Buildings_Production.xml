  <VFEA_ElectricMendingStation.description>An electric station with various apparatus used to fix weapons, armor and apparel. It’s a long process. Such stations are a must-have in the vaults to prevent the equipment, such as guns and tools, from needing replacement.</VFEA_ElectricMendingStation.description>

  <VFEA_FueledMendingStation.description>A wood-fueled station with various apparatus used to fix weapons, armor and apparel. It’s a long process. Such stations are a must-have in the vaults to prevent the equipment, such as guns and tools, from needing replacement.</VFEA_FueledMendingStation.description>

  <VFEA_AncientHydroponicFarm.label>ancient hydroponic farm</VFEA_AncientHydroponicFarm.label>
  <VFEA_AncientHydroponicFarm.description>An artificial nutrient bath for growing plants. The nutrients pumps must work continuously; the plants will die if power is cut. Contains a set of built-in sun lamps.\n\nThis structure was built by a long forgotten civilisation and the technology can no longer be replicated. It will never suffer breakdowns, and it operates more efficiently during solar flare incidents.</VFEA_AncientHydroponicFarm.description>

  <VFEA_AncientCookingStation.description>A large stove and butchering station connected together to streamline the cooking process.\n\nThis structure was built by a long forgotten civilisation and the technology can no longer be replicated. It will never suffer breakdowns, and it operates more efficiently during solar flare incidents.</VFEA_AncientCookingStation.description>
