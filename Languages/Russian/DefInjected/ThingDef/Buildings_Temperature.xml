  <VFEA_AncientCooler.description>An ancient air-cooling machine. Cool air comes out one side, while the hot air gets funneled through a series of pipes deep into the ground. Can be used to cool down rooms during summer, or to create a walk-in freezer.\n\nThis structure was built by a long forgotten civilisation and the technology can no longer be replicated. It will never suffer breakdowns, and it operates more efficiently during solar flare incidents.</VFEA_AncientCooler.description>
